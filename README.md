# How to use

Here is a description of the 6 inputs and what they do:

```
1. Default screen
    - Each pair of LED-Potentiometer represent a step.
    - The LED indicates when the step is active
    - The potentiometer sets the note of the step within 2 octaves
        - At 0 the note is muted
2. Clock
    1. Usage

            - The rotary acts as a clock divider selector
            - Turning the rotary will enter the Divider screen
        2. If no MIDI clock is received
            - The sequencer sends midi clock messages       (TODO)
            - The rotary sets the tempo from 10 to 200bpm
        3. Clicking will toggle Play
    2. Display

            - Turning the rotary will allow selection from no division to division by 16
            - Active selection is indicated by a blinking LED witin 8 solid lit LED
3. Direction
    1. Usage
        - Push once the Direction button to enter the Direction screen

    2. Modes
        1. Forward,
        2. Backward
        3. Pendulum
            - Going forward and backward alternatively
        4. Forward Transposer                               (TODO)
            - The bar becomes 4 steps. The 4 steps at the top are being transposed by the 4 steps at the bottom.Â 
    3. Display
        - The selected direction is indicated by a blinking LED 
        - Screen stays 1s after last push
4. Scale                                                    (TODO)
